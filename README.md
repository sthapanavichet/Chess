# Chess
Chess engine made from scratch using pygame to render in pieces and the board. Algorithms for moves and checking is all coded by me.

# To run the game
Simply run the board.py or boardv2.py, either files work.

# difference between board.py and boardv2.py
board is an older design of the game, it's not as optimized as boardv2.py
